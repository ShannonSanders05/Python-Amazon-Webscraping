## Project Title: Python-Amazon-Web-Scraping

**Description**:

In this project, I developed an automated web scraping algorithm focused on an Amazon product page. The project includes the following key components:

1. **Initial HTML Scraping**: Initially, I scraped and downloaded the HTML content of the Amazon product page, extracting relevant information such as product names, prices, and reviews.
2. **Automation Implementation**: Created an automated algorithm using Python and scheduling tools to scrape the Amazon site daily.
3. **Data Appending to CSV**: Designed the algorithm to append the newly scraped information to a CSV file. This ensures the continuous growth of a comprehensive dataset over time.
